## IN A NUTSHELL...

### THE TIMEFRAME

You play for days, not hours.
The game is played over a week.

### Missions

At the beginning of the week you draw 7 missions. They are mostly nice things to do for each other and around the home. Each mission is worth points based on difficulty.

### Strategy

Here’s the catch – you have to complete your missions in secret! The whole week you are trying to guess your partner’s missions while completing your own. If you guess your spouse’s mission, it’s not worth any points. An incorrect guess and you lose a point.

### Rewards

On the last day, reveal your missions and then add up earned points including brownie points. Subtract points for incomplete missions, incorrect guesses, and strategies. It is not always black and white, be prepared to argue your case... that is part of the fun.
